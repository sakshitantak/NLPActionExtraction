As a user, I'd like the app to recommend a walking regimen tailored to my specific recovery plan.
As a user, I'd like the app to create a walking path in my own neighborhood and track me as I go on the walk so that itï¿½s incredibly easy for me to follow my regimen.
As a user, I'd like it if the map showed me optional paths I can take through my neighborhood in order to achieve the prescribed distance.
As a user, I'd like the app to give me digital rewards that I can earn for completing my regimen.
As a user, I'd like it if the rewards showed up in different places along my walk, so as I walked, I continued to collect rewards.
As a user, I'd like the app to create a summary report that I can share with my physician during my follow up visits.
As a user, I'd like to be able to share with friends and family when I achieve milestones in my regimen.
